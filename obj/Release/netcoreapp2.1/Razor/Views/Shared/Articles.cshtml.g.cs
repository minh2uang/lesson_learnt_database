                    Katlyn Broadway, a project manager for SoftMax, has just put the finishing touches on her final project report before the meeting with her manager, Mark Johnson. The last few weeks have been grueling trying to get the lessons learned feedback from project participants for the final report. Katlyn thought she had properly prepared and had asked all the right people to attend the meeting. Not all the invited people attended the meeting, and it turned into a complaint session where some of the meeting attendees were upset with connotations made by other meeting attendees.

Further, after reviewing the top three lessons learned for the project, Mark recognized that he was hearing the same issues again and realized that these were the same lessons on projects around the world.

                    Mark realized that SoftMax had no standards for collecting, analyzing, storing, disseminating, and reusing lessons learned. Consequently, it is losing valuable knowledge gained during projects and learning between projects. Considering that many projects have overlapping components, SoftMax can save money by not reinventing the wheel every time a new project is started. Mark felt that project managers could reduce project costs by learning from past projects, by implementing past successes, and by avoiding past failures...

                    The only way to avoid problems happening yet again in the future is to carefully consider what went wrong this time (and why), and decide what can be done differently next time to avoid those problems. Likewise, teams can help others duplicate their successes only if they can express concretely what went well on a project, and why. Lessons learned processes help identify and transfer such recommendations forward from one team to another. The specific lessons and recommendations generated via lessons learned surveys and meetings yield concrete actions for other teams.                     <br>

                        This process is also useful within a particular project. Some teams have interim lessons learned meetings during or at the end of each major project phase, with an eye to recognizing what is working well, or not so well for the team right now, so they can take the chance to adjust. It's also a good idea to capture lessons periodically during a longer project, before the team moves on and forgets the fine points of lessons learned so far.

                    Either way, the goal is to build upon the successes and lessons of prior teams, and—within a project—to reflect on what is working, and where changes could improve the team's work and the overall project.

                    Lessons learned approach, based on the acquisition and transfer of experiences and ideas for improvements, is one of the elements of an efficient project management.

                    <br>
                    Management methodologies, both classic and agile, more or less precisely describe the way, in which the knowledge acquisition process should be performed. I am not going to quote them here, but I would like to share some thoughts and my own experiences in this field.
                    <div>
                        Usually, the lessons learned are organized at the end of a project or, in the case of longer operations, at the end of a particular stage. I think that it is a generally better idea to register them continuously, during the performance of the related actions.

                    In the course of time, we tend to loose many ideas and observations, which are superseded by other, more recent events. In my projects, I try to keep such registers on an ongoing basis. Google Docs is a very helpful tool here, enabling the creation of spreadsheets that can be shared with other members of the team. This way, they can note down their own observations and ideas for improvement, immediately after they appear. At the end of the project, we may discuss them and pass them on.

                    or example, if you’ve been in a situation before with managing stakeholders and you know how to work with them it’s a useful lesson to pass on to the next project manager to enable quicker, better progress.

                     However, across the project management industry lessons learned is not always done effectively.

                     This might be a lack of willingness to learn from mistakes encountered throughout project delivery or a fear of admitting and sharing the mistakes made along the way. Certainly, it could highlight areas where project managers didn’t adhere to an agreed approach; in a “blame culture”, organizations might not embrace the idea that people make mistakes and we learn as much from them as doing things right. If organizations did everyth");

                    Also, where a lessons learned report is compiled it can often go to the PMO and get filed away rather than using the information at the scoping stage of a subsequent project. With the turnover of new projects and programmes often happening quickly organizations can neglect making the time and resources to ensure lessons learned are collated at all.
